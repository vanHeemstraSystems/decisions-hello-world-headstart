# Decisions "Hello World" - Headstart

## Download Free Personal License
he Decisions Platform can be installed and used for free - without a license for development work and exploration. Any unlicensed server will operate in ‘personal server mode’, which is fully functional with one limitation - it can only be accessed from the device that it’s installed on. This allows developers to play with the SDK, for people to work on laptops, etc. - without needing a license. If your company is already a Decisions customer, you are entitled to support - even on the free personal server.
